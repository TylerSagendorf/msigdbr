Description: Provides the 'Molecular Signatures Database' (MSigDB) gene sets
    typically used with the 'Gene Set Enrichment Analysis' (GSEA) software
    (Subramanian et al. 2005 <doi:10.1073/pnas.0506580102>, Liberzon et al. 2015
    <doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004>) in a standard R data frame with key-value
    pairs. The package includes the original human gene symbols and NCBI/Entrez
    IDs as well as the equivalents for frequently studied model organisms such
    as mouse, rat, pig, fly, and yeast.
